CYBERSECURITY FUNDAMENTALS

This module introduces the essential building blocks of cybersecurity, including its purpose, principles, frameworks, and terminology. It sets the stage for deeper technical concepts in later modules.

What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access.

Cybersecurity Misconceptions
1. Cybersecurity is only relevant to large organizations- This is a lie. Cybersecurity applies to all businesses
2. Antivirus software alone provides complete protection- Antivirus tools provide only one layer of protection in a multi-layered security strategy.
3. Once I implement cybersecurity measures, I am fully protected- Cybersecurity is an ongoing process; proactive measures are essential.
4. It is an IT department responsibility- Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across all departments.
5. I have nothing of value to attract cybercriminals- Everyone is a potential target regardless of the perceived value of their assets.

   Impact of Cybersecurity on Businesses 
Cybersecurity threats include:
a) Phishing
b) malware
c) ransomware
d) Inside threats
d) Denial-of-service (DOS) attack, etc.

     1. Impact of Cybersecurity threats on Businesses
         1. Damage to Reputation
         2. Financial loss
         3. Operation disruption
         4. Legal and regulatory consequences/penalties
    2. Importance of Cybersecurity to Businesses
         1. Protection of sensitive data, eg, customer data and financial records information
         2. Cybersecurity preserves business continuity
         3. It safeguards customer trust
         4. Compliance with regulations
         5. Helps mitigate financial loss
            
  Cybersecurity Frameworks
NIST Framework- National Institute of Standards and Technology helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks using 5 key functions:
 1. Indentify- understand assets and prioritize resources.
 2. Protect- implemenr measures for asset protection.
 3. Detect- continuously monitor for security events.
 4. Respod- promptly address and mitigate incidents.
 5. Recover- restore systems, prevent future incidents.

 Core Principles of Cybersecurity
CIA Triad
  Confidentialityy- protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  Integrity- ensures data accuracy and trustworthy.
  availabilty- Ensures accessibility of data when needed.
Defence in Depth Approach
 A layered security approach where multiple defensive mechanisms are places across various levels.

Cybersecurity Terminologies
1. Vulnerability- a weeakness that can be exploited.
2. Risk- the potential for loss or damage.
3. threat- a potential cause for unwanted impact to a system or data.
4. Exploit- to take advantage of a vulnerability.
5. Firewall- a network security system that monitors and filters unwanted traffic.
6. Hackers- white hat, black hat, and gray hat hackers

   Key Takeawys
   - Cybersecurity is essential for every organization.
   - Misconceptions can lead to severe exposure and risk.
   - Clear knowledge of common terminologies is crucial for communication and analysis in cybersecurity.
   - Frameworks like NIST provide a structured approach to handling sensitive data
   - Understanding the CIA Triad and Defense in Depth is foundational for security planning.

     This is the first module in my ongoing cybersecurity journey. I'll continue to document each step in this repository.
